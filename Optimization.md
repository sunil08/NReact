## Optimization

# Single Responsibility
- If we have a function, class or single idenetity of our code then it must have single responsibility.
- Bread down into multiple components.
- Code becomes reusable, maintainable, testable

Custom hooks makes our code more readable, modular, reusable, optimized.
Not mandatory to make custom hooks.
